Pathing Sandbox
Created by: Logan McArthur

This is a programming sandbox to experiment with different pathfinding algorithms.
This repository contains two Eclipse projects that show the experimentation I have done with pathfinding algorithms.

The AStarPathing directory contains the first two builds of my sandbox, which are Grid.java and RefinedGrid.java respectively.
These were built as I was learning the basics of pathfinding in general and are designed to provide an easy way to set up environments to plot a course around obstacles.

The Multi Agent Pathfinding directory contains my most recent iteration of the sandbox, and contains a system to allow multiple, simultaneous agents to plot courses through an environment. It supports both A* and Jump Point Search and will show which cells are being evaluated during their operation.
